# Peer-graded-Assignment-Prediction-Assignment
This is my peer graded asignment on Practical Machine learning. I will submit my repositories and my html files and I will explain how I solved the project in my files.
This assignment is about using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the way the people do the exercise.
